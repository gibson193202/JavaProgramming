[Elton John:]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
 
Cold, cold heart (Oh)
Hard done by you
Some things looking better, baby (Oh)
Just passin' through (Oh no, no, no, no)
 
[Dua Lipa:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no)
And this is what I should've ever said
Well I thought it, but I kept it hid
 
[Elton John:]
Cold, cold heart (Oh)
Hard done by you
Some things looking better, baby (Oh)
Just passin' through (Oh no, no, no, no)
 
[Dua Lipa:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no)
And this is what I should've ever said
Well I thought it, but I kept it hid

'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no)
And this is what I should've ever said
Well I thought it, but I kept it hid
 
Uh, sugar
(Oh no, no, no, no)
